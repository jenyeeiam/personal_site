Leveraged off the shelf LLM models to create a multi-label classification model. The model was trained on a dataset of 1000+ text feedback samples and their corresponding quality scores. The model was then used to predict the scores of a new set of text feedback, a process that would take hours to do manually.  

Technologies used:
* Hugging Face
* Python
* Pandas
* PyTorch
