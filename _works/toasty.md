A common problem with Toastmasters clubs is the delegation of roles for each meeting. Often long email chains are used to sign up for the week's meeting which can become hard to keep track of. This project created a central location where members could go and drag and drop their name into a role, weeks in advance. 

Technologies used:
* Ruby / Rails
* React
