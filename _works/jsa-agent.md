The Japanese Professional Softball League is always looking for foreign players to play in the league. However, language barriers and geography makes it difficult to recruit and find players who are available to play. Players created profiles and provided video to show their skills, and coaches were able to view the profiles and contact the players within the app through a chat room equipped with a translator. The project made it easy for Japanese coaches to view players who are available to play for the season and communicate with the players they were interested in.

Technologies used:
* Ruby / Rails
* React
* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft Translate API
