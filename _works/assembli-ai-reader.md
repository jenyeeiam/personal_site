I wanted to create an application to read podcasts to me, but also highlight the words as they are being read. AssemblyAI's API was used to transcribe the podcast and apply timestamps to each word. The words are then highlighted in real-time as they are read. Unfortunately, the transcription and timestamps were not as accurate as I hoped.  

Technologies used:
* Flask
* Python
* AssemblyAI
